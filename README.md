Assignment # 18: Tableau Challenge

Assignment Background:
As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so my first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

This is my over 18th, and forst Tableau assignment. In this assignment I performed the following tasks:
- Created a Teableau Public account.
- Saved my assignment as a project to Tableau Public account accessible at: https://public.tableau.com/profile/waqas.zahick#!/vizhome/Tableau-Challenge_16200488010000/Story1
- Uploaded my assignment as a ".twbx" file and uploaded to my GitHub account.
- Aggregated the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and found two unexpected phenomena.
- Designed 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total), working with a 3-year timespan i.e. from 2019 to 2021 and merging it.  

The following are some questions that I tackled:
- How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
- By what percentage has total ridership grown?
- How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
- What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)
- Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)
- Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?
- How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?
- How does the average trip duration change by age?
- What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?
- Which bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection in the timespan?
- How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

I created the following visualizations:
Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.
Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.

For my final presentation, I created a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
My assignment submission includes:
- A link to your Tableau Public workbook that includes: 
- 4-10 Total "Phenomenon" Visualizations
- 2 Dashboards
- 1 City Official Map
- 1 Story

My Analysis:
After creating and analyzing my visualizations, I figured out that:
1. The trips for the most used bikes often started on or around the same stations. This may be indicative of the fact that ther is a need to increase the supply of bicycles in those areas. Adding more bikes to the targeted areas or stations will allow more users to have a bike available as well as preventing the same bikes from enduring heavy wear-and-tear, depreciation, increase the repair cost or worse, the risk of injury to the bicycle user(s).

2. Another phenomenon that was uncovered from my visualizations, is that most of our riders are between the ages of 27 and 40 with a median age of about 37.

3. The final phenomenon that I discovered during this assignment is that the most popular start times are 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. This makes sense as it is similar to when the surge during the rush hours. People tend to use bicycle as they are going to work in the morning, and then again when they leave work in the evening. Another reason for the eveing surge around 6 p.m could also be from students finishing their day and heading back home.
